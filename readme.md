## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my participation in the Kaggle competition House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. The goal of this competition is to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features. <br>

The competition can be found on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main directories:

* data: 

This directory contains the data obtained from Kaggle. It includes both the training dataset (train.csv) and the test dataset (test.csv). Also here you can find the "data_description.txt" which it includes each feature details as provided from kaggle.

* model: 

Here, you'll find the Jupyter Notebook (House_Prices_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb) where I created the prediction model. This notebook includes details about the data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of the prediction model using XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

* stored_results: 

This directory holds the stored predictions of the test dataset. You can find the predictions in a CSV file (predicted_testdf_prices.csv), which includes the predicted sale prices for the houses in the test set.
